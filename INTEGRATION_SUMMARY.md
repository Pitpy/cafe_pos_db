# Multi-Branch Caf√© POS System - Integration Complete! üéâ

## System Overview

Your comprehensive multi-branch caf√© POS system has been successfully integrated with enterprise-grade capabilities. Here's what has been implemented:

## ‚úÖ Core Multi-Branch Features

### 1. **Branch Management System**

- **5 new tables** for complete branch operations:
  - `branches` - Main branch registry with 25+ attributes
  - `branch_configs` - Flexible JSONB configuration storage
  - `employee_branches` - Many-to-many employee-branch assignments
  - `branch_schedules` - Detailed operating hours management
  - Multi-branch inventory management tables

### 2. **Enhanced Existing Tables**

- Added `branch_id` to core operational tables:
  - `employees` - Track employee home branch
  - `orders` - Associate orders with specific branches
  - `inventory_transactions` - Branch-specific inventory tracking
- Added `primary_branch_id` to `customers` for loyalty programs

### 3. **Business Logic Functions** (8 functions)

```sql
-- Core multi-branch functions now available:
get_employee_branch(employee_id)           -- Get employee's primary branch
employee_can_access_branch(emp_id, branch) -- Check access permissions
get_branch_price(branch_id, item_id)       -- Branch-specific pricing
check_branch_stock(branch_id, item_id)     -- Real-time inventory
set_employee_session(emp_id, branch_id)    -- Secure branch switching
is_branch_open(branch_id, time, day)       -- Operating hours check
migrate_to_multibranch()                   -- Data migration utility
multibranch_health_check()                 -- System validation
```

### 4. **Advanced Reporting & Analytics** (4 views)

- `branch_performance_summary` - KPI dashboard per branch
- `daily_branch_sales` - Daily sales analytics by location
- `employee_branch_performance` - Cross-branch employee metrics

### 5. **Enhanced Security & Permissions**

Extended existing RBAC system with 5 new branch-specific permissions:

- `MANAGE_BRANCH` - Create/modify branch settings
- `VIEW_ALL_BRANCHES` - Access cross-branch data
- `TRANSFER_INVENTORY` - Move stock between branches
- `CROSS_BRANCH_REPORTS` - Generate multi-location reports
- `SWITCH_BRANCH` - Change active branch context

### 6. **Performance Optimization**

**12 new indexes** optimized for multi-branch queries:

```sql
-- Branch relationship indexes
idx_employees_branch_id, idx_orders_branch_id, idx_inventory_transactions_branch_id
idx_customers_primary_branch_id, idx_employee_branches_composite
idx_branch_schedules_composite, idx_branches_location_gis

-- Inventory management indexes
idx_central_inventory_lookup, idx_branch_inventory_composite
idx_inventory_transfers_composite, idx_branch_configs_lookup
idx_branches_performance_composite
```
